Subject: [Zephir-dev] List of remaining tasks for development
Message-ID: <428D1057.8020307@free.Fr>

Hi geeks,

Have you taken a look to the application and the remaining tasks to do?

I put the list that we had at end of school (only UI side) on the wiki :
http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Tasks_to_do

Please let me know if you
- have looked,
- will look (when... about, not a fix date don't worry!)
- won't be able to look

Moreover, Ludo you told me that you cannot commit the server for the 
moment because there are too much errors.
Do you know when you'll be able to post a clean version ?
Or is it possible to have an intermediate version if someone wants to 
develop?


I don't force and won't force any body to work ( I have already a lot of 
difficulty to find time for ZephIR project myself ;) ),
I want just to know if you do something or not in order to not wait you 
for nothing. It is just for other members because we are 6 so it is 
needed to give a status of what we can do and cannot do in order to 
block nobody.
I don't want you to see me as a tyran :D   Each one does what he can 
when he can, and nothing if he can do anything, it doesn't matter, we 
have all a lot of things to do.
But the only thing needed, is to answer to mails and give a status of 
your situation if you can't work on ZephIR or have time to work on...

I think that  you understand what I mean (I am not sure to be really 
clear :D )

So wait for your answer about the list of tasks to discuss on skype about
and wait for your answer Ludo about the repository.

See U geeks ;)
Bryce

Yop everybody

I did lot of modification on the server and on the client UI. But there 
are still lot of problems, the planning is no more working.
I suggest to have a discussion on the remaining work to do, and the bugs 
I am dealing with.

If everybody is free tonight, we could maybe discuss about it.
My login on skype is boucher93500

Have a nice day

Yep

I can be there tonight only between 19h30 and 20h30. So if we do it, we need
that everybody will be present at 19h30.

Confirm if you can or can't be present tonight.

Else I propose tomorrow at 13h00 or 13h30.

I don't have for the moment skype account. Come on msn please at 19h25 to share
your skype login name.

++ gentlemen
Bryce

PS : If we won't have confirmation from all before 17h30 PM, today call will be
canceled. After this time, I won't be able to check my mails.

Message-ID: <12A8F789-F0B9-426C-9FD3-11D0EE7BECF9@genezys.net>

As everybody knows... not, I'm working on a new logo for ZephIR.

I am trying to use Illustrator to produce something, and this is my  
first result. Please add comments about what you like, dislike, what  
should be kept and what should be changed so I can continue the work.
