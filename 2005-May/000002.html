<PRE>Hi geeks,

Have you taken a look to the application and the remaining tasks to do?

I put the list that we had at end of school (only UI side) on the wiki :
<A HREF="http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Tasks_to_do">http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Tasks_to_do</A>

Please let me know if you
- have looked,
- will look (when... about, not a fix date don't worry!)
- won't be able to look

Moreover, Ludo you told me that you cannot commit the server for the 
moment because there are too much errors.
Do you know when you'll be able to post a clean version ?
Or is it possible to have an intermediate version if someone wants to 
develop?


I don't force and won't force any body to work ( I have already a lot of 
difficulty to find time for ZephIR project myself ;) ),
I want just to know if you do something or not in order to not wait you 
for nothing. It is just for other members because we are 6 so it is 
needed to give a status of what we can do and cannot do in order to 
block nobody.
I don't want you to see me as a tyran :D   Each one does what he can 
when he can, and nothing if he can do anything, it doesn't matter, we 
have all a lot of things to do.
But the only thing needed, is to answer to mails and give a status of 
your situation if you can't work on ZephIR or have time to work on...

I think that  you understand what I mean (I am not sure to be really 
clear :D )

So wait for your answer about the list of tasks to discuss on skype about
and wait for your answer Ludo about the repository.

See U geeks ;)
Bryce
